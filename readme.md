SocialCamp is a naive [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) clone, it serves two purposes at this moment.

One, it will be a free alternative to Basecamp, which I'm currently using with my colleagues for discussing ideas on learning new technologies.

Two, it will be a playground where I apply the technologies I've learned, Rails, Coffeescript, jQuery, to name a few.

Maybe another purpose is to finally get myself on GitHub, and the open source world.

Let's keep learning, and bring more good stuff to this world.
